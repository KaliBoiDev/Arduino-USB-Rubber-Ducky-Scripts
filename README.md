# Arduino-USB-Rubber-Ducky-Scripts

This is a compilation of Rubber Ducky Scripts that I ported to C++ using an HID library and an Arduino Pro Micro.

To use these you will need and Arduino compatible microcontroller that is also capable of HID such as the Pro Micro, Leonardo, etc.
You will also need to install the HID library used in the project, credit to NicoHood. Download link here https://github.com/NicoHood/HID.
